# Hi, I’m Ernesto

I’m a full stack software engineer who enjoys building tools that make life easier.  
Most of my work is in Django and React, but I also work a lot with AWS, automation, and cloud services to keep projects reliable and scalable.  

Right now I’m:
- Modernizing legacy systems at Metlife Legal Plans  
- Building side projects (more on [ernestosoftware.com](https://ernestosoftware.com))  
- Exploring SaaS ideas and experimenting with new tools  

### What I like working on
- Automating repetitive tasks with Python ( iykyk )
- Making sense of messy data  
- Building clean, reusable React components  
- Shipping projects to learn by doing
